DO NOT SHOW THIS PORTFOLIO IN CLASS 

My corpus entails songs from the heist-themed playlist 'Very Agent' (166 songs), made by Spotify user 'Jenine'. Jenine is a game designer who uses this playlist to be reminded of the heist mood when working on a heist game she's currently working on. I'm going to make the music to this game, so I've been getting into this playlist recently and would like to know what the essence of a good heist song is, if there is such a thing at all. 

While there clearly are great and not-so-great heist tunes, genre doens't seem to be the (only) determining factor; I've encountered music from several genres and several era's in the 'Very Agent' playlist (and other heist playlists), ranging accross funk, jazz, hiphop and cuban music, to mention a few. Are there overarching patterns within heist music accross any or all of these genres? Are there commonalities in heist music that could be used to define it as a genre? 

In order to dive into this, the songs in the 'Very Agent' playlist can be compared as a function of genre, and as a function of decade. Any similarities and contrast that might arise from this can in turn be compared to similarities and contrasts that result from a comparison between the same genres / decades that are found when comparing music that is not exclusive to the style of heist. This kind of comparison might move give some answers to the question whether heist music is can be a genre, and what that genre would be determined by, for example if there are similarities found accross genres within the 'Very Agent' playlist, but not outside of it. These similarities could then be examined further in a smaller corpus. It should be noted that, when comparing accross decades, convention can, and is likely, to be used as a communicative tool in the setting of heist movies. In the same way a black dress has a different meaning on a funeral than on any other event, a 1950's jazz song might have a different meaning in a heist movie than it has in any other setting.
